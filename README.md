# ModTools app

App for Freegle volunteers - for authorised moderators of local communities in the UK.

Freegle is a platform for online reuse of unwanted items.

This app for volunteers receives notifications and provides a wrapper for the website at https://modtools.org.

Package: org.ilovefreegle.modtools

The development has been funded by [Freegle](https://www.ilovefreegle.org) for use in the UK,
but it is an open source platform which can be used or adapted by others.

**It would be very lovely if you sponsored us.**
